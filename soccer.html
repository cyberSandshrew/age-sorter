<!--        Programming Challenge
            On Your Own:    ch. 5
            Description:
			Create a html web page that allows the coach of a town’s soccer league to enter the ages of all the children who have 
			registered for soccer this year. 
			Children between the ages of 4 and 15 are allowed to sign up for soccer but there can be a lot of variation in the number of 
			children who sign up each year and their ages. Eventually the children will be placed into one of 
			three leagues: Junior, Intermediate, and Senior. The Junior League is for children ages 4–7, the Intermediate League is for 
			children ages 8–11, and the Senior League is for children ages 12–15. The coach wants to know how many children will be in each group
			. Your program should allow the coach to enter the ages of as many children as desired and should keep track
			of how many are in each group. The final display should tell the coach how many children signed up and how many will be in each group. 
			Save your page as soccer.html and be sure to include an appropriate page title.
